        A story of how a cramped after-school classroom, an app built during COVID, and a few

                <p class="story-body">
                  I wrote my first line of code in grade 11, sitting in a cramped classroom after
                  school. I had no idea what I was doing — but I was completely absorbed by the
                  feeling that I could build anything with a few lines of logic. That spark pushed
                  me into the Technovation challenge, where my team and I built VolunTime, a mobile
                  app designed to help students find volunteer opportunities more easily during
                  COVID. We centralized listings, added fast filters, and focused on reducing the
                  frustration of scattered information. To our surprise, VolunTime made it to the
                  Technovation quarter-finals, and for the first time, I saw how software could
                  genuinely improve people’s lives.

                  As I started applying to universities, Carleton stood out immediately — the
                  tight-knit engineering community, the quieter campus, and the feeling that I could
                  actually grow there. After becoming a Raven, I dove headfirst into exploring what
                  kind of engineer I wanted to be.

                  My first internship at BlackBerry IVY opened the door to embedded systems, data
                  pipelines, and model optimization. From there, each experience layered on something
                  new: building backend systems, working with distributed services, writing
                  security-focused tools, and learning how to build software that is reliable at
                  scale.

                  Today, I’m a Software Engineering student at Carleton University with 4+ years of
                  experience building backend systems, security-oriented tooling, and data-driven
                  pipelines. I love working at the intersection of finance, machine learning, and
                  security — turning complex data into meaningful, trustworthy systems that people
                  can rely on.
